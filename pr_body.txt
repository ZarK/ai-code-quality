## Modular Code Quality System

This PR implements a beautiful modular code quality system inspired by ai-ws-finetune.

### Key Features
- Modular Design: Each tool is a small function, phases combine multiple checks
- Technology Detection: Automatically detects and runs appropriate checks
- Phase Management: Staged rollout with regression prevention
- Biome Integration: Uses Biome for JS/TS (no ESLint/Prettier needed)
- Actual Quality Checks: Real ShellCheck, ruff, mypy, Biome, Vitest integration

### Phase Structure
- Phase 1: Basic Formatting & Linting
- Phase 2: Type Checking & Advanced Linting  
- Phase 3: Testing

The system now provides actual code quality enforcement!
